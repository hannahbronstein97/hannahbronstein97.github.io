## Currently

My reserach focus is on stem cell progenitor migration in the zebrafish retina. I am currently completing a year long independent research project in Dr. Kara Cerveny’s Lab at Reed College focusing on retinal stem cell specification in developing zebrafish retinal stem cells. I have a passion for the outdoors and the study of biology, particularly molecular and cell biology in developmental contexts.

## Relevant Coursework

`Fall 2016`
**Independent Research Project in Gene Regulation**
Designed and completed a half semester long research project on transforming a zebrafish gene into Xenopus frogs using a plasmid derived from E. Coli in Dr. Janis Shampay’s lab.

`Spring 2017`
**Independent Research Project in Cell Biology**
Designed and completed a half semester long research project on the effects of Taxol on Drosophila cell cycle arrest using fluorescent microscoy in Dr. Derek Applewhite’s Lab. 

`Spring 2018`
**Independent Research Project in Microbiology**
Designed and completed a half semester long research project on _Serratia marcescens_ in Dr. Jay Mellie's Lab. Used transposon mutagenesis to identify gene(s) necessary for the expression of a red pigment phenotype.

`Fall 2018`
**Independent Research Project in Ecology** 
Designed and completed a three week long research project on the effects of smoke exsposure on stomatal conductrance in incense cedar in Dr. Aaron Ramirez’s Lab. 


## Research Experience:

`Fall 2018-Spring 2019`
**Undergraduate Thesis in Developmental Biology, Reed College**
Currently completing a year long thesis project with Dr. Kara Cerveny on early retinal morphogenesis of the ciliary marginal zone of Zebrafish using transgenic techniques and fluorescent microscopy to live image stem cell movement.

`Fall 2017`
**Undergraduate Independent Research in Developmental Biology**
Designed and completed a year long lab research project on the HDAC1 zebrafish mutant. Transplanted HDAC1 mutant cells into wild type zebrafish to analyze the environmental signalling effects of muatant cells existing in a wild type environment.
