## Currently

My reserach focus is on stem cell progenior migration in the zebrafish retina. Currently completing a year long independent research project in Dr. Kara Cerveny’s Lab at Reed College focusing on Retinal Stem Cell specification in the developing Zebrafish Retinal Stem Cell Niche. I have a passion for the outdoors and the study of biology, particularly molecular and cell biology in developmental contexts.

`Spring 2017`
**Independent Research Project in Cell Biology**
Designed and completed a half semester long research project on the effects of Taxol on Drosophila cell cycle arrest using fluorescent miscrisoy in Dr. Derek Applewhite’s Lab. 

`Spring 2018`

`Fall 2018`
**Independent Research Project in Ecology** 
Designed and completed a three week long research project on the effects of smoke esxposure on stomatal conductrance in Incense Cedar in Dr. Aaron Ramirez’s Lab. 


## Research Experience:

`Fall 2018-Spring 2019`
**Undergraduate Thesis in Developmental Biology, Reed College**
Currently completing a year long thesis with DR. Kara Cerveny on early retinal morphogenesis of the Ciliary Marginal Zone of  Zebrafish using transgenic techniques and fluorescent microscopy to live image stem cell movement.

`Fall 2017`
**Undergraduate Independent Research in Developmental Biology**
Designed and completed a year long lab research project on the hdac1 zebrafish mutanat. Transplanted hdac1 mutant cells into wild type zebrafish to analyze the environmental signalling effects of muatant cells existing in a wild type enviroemnt.
