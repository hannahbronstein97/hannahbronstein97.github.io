excerpt: "About Me"
---

I am currently a senior at Reed College studying stem cell development in the zebrafish retina. I am interested in working in a biological sciences research lab focusing in ecology and/or cell and molecular biology. I have a passion for the outdoors and learning about the relationships between living things and their environments.


## Current Projects and Interests:

### Undergraduate Research
- Undergraduate thesis in developmental biology at Reed College. Independent research projects in gene regulation, cell biology, microbiology, developmental biology, and ecology at Reed College.

### Other Interests
- Hiking and mountaineering in the Pacific North West and Adirondack Sate Park.
- Musical performance (a capella singing and acoustic guitar).
